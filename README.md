# Jastrow factorization
This repository contains the following three different programs for testing the Jastrow factorization of ab initio Hamiltonians.

## Error
This directory includes the codes that plots the difference of approximated Hamiltonians using
- singular value decomposition (SVD)
- optimization of J
- optimization of J and U.

## PEC (Potential energy curve)
This directory is for plotting the potential energy curves for H2 and LiH in various approximations.

## Time
This directory contais the codes that plots the time took to complete the above mentioned computation.
